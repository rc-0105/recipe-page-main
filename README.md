## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to aply styles to list like ul and also tables doing specific things to parts of the table like de tr or td, also at the beggining i couldnt make the container in a good way so it center himself but i managed to see my last codes and i center it succesfully. 

### Continued development

I want to make the css look better, its unorganized and i think that could be optimized
